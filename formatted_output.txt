<s>[INST] 3. What is feature engineering? How does it affect the model’s performance? [/INST] Feature engineering refers to developing some new features by using existing features. Sometimes there is a very subtle mathematical relation between some features which if explored properly then the new features can be developed using those mathematical operations. </s>
<s>[INST] 4. What is overfitting in machine learning and how can it be avoided? [/INST] Overfitting happens when the model learns patterns as well as the noises present in the data this leads to high performance on the training data but very low performance for data that the model has not seen earlier. </s>
<s>[INST] 5. Why we cannot use linear regression for a classification task? [/INST] The main reason why we cannot use linear regression for a classification task is that the output of linear regression is continuous and unbounded, while classification requires discrete and bounded output values. </s>
<s>[INST] 6. Why do we perform normalization? [/INST] To achieve stable and fast training of the model we use normalization techniques to bring all the features to a certain scale or range of values. If we do not perform normalization then there are chances that the gradient will not converge to the global or local minima and end up oscillating back and forth. </s>
<s>[INST] 7. What is the difference between precision and recall? [/INST] Precision is the ratio between the true positives(TP) and all the positive examples (TP+FP) predicted by the model. In other words, precision measures how many of the predicted positive examples are actually true positives. It is a measure of the model's ability to avoid false positives and make accurate positive predictions. </s>
<s>[INST] 8. What is the difference between upsampling and downsampling? [/INST] In upsampling method, we increase the number of samples in the minority class by randomly selecting some points from the minority class and adding them to the dataset repeat this process till the dataset gets balanced for each class. But, here is a disadvantage the training accuracy becomes high as in each epoch model trained more than once in each epoch but the same high accuracy is not observed in the validation accuracy. </s>
<s>[INST] 9. What is data leakage and how can we identify it? [/INST] If there is a high correlation between the target variable and the input features then this situation is referred to as data leakage. This is because when we train our model with that highly correlated feature then the model gets most of the target variable's information in the training process only and it has to do very little to achieve high accuracy. In this situation, the model gives pretty decent performance both on the training as well as the validation data but as we use that model to make actual predictions then the model’s performance is not up to the mark. This is how we can identify data leakage. </s>

<s>[INST] 13. Is it always necessary to use an 80:20 ratio for the train test split? [/INST] No, there is no such necessary condition that the data must be split into 80:20 ratio. The main purpose of the splitting is to have some data which the model has not seen previously so, that we can evaluate the performance of the model. </s>
<s>[INST] 14. What is Principal Component Analysis? [/INST] PCA(Principal Component Analysis) is an unsupervised machine learning dimensionality reduction technique in which we trade off some information or patterns of the data at the cost of reducing its size significantly. In this algorithm, we try to preserve the variance of the original dataset up to a great extent let’s say 95%. For very high dimensional data sometimes even at the loss of 1% of the variance, we can reduce the data size significantly. </s>
<s>[INST] 15. What is one-shot learning? [/INST] One-shot learning is a concept in machine learning where the model is trained to recognize the patterns in datasets from a single example instead of training on large datasets. This is useful when we haven't large datasets. It is applied to find the similarity and dissimilarities between the two images. </s>

<s>[INST] 17. What is the difference between one hot encoding and ordinal encoding? [/INST] One Hot encoding and ordinal encoding both are different methods to convert categorical features to numeric ones the difference is in the way they are implemented. In one hot encoding, we create a separate column for each category and add 0 or 1 as per the value corresponding to that row. </s>
<s>[INST] 18. How can you conclude about the model's performance using the confusion matrix? [/INST] Confusion matrix summarizes the performance of a classification model. In a confusion matrix, we get four types of output (in case of a binary classification problem) which are TP, TN, FP, and FN. As we know that there are two diagonals possible in a square, and one of these two diagonals represents the numbers for which our model's prediction and the true labels are the same. Our target is also to maximize the values along these diagonals. From the confusion matrix, we can calculate various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. </s>
<s>[INST] 20. What is the difference between the k-means and k-means++ algorithms? [/INST] The only difference between the two is in the way centroids are initialized. In the k-means algorithm, the centroids are initialized randomly from the given points. There is a drawback in this method that sometimes this random initialization leads to non-optimized clusters due to maybe initialization of two clusters close to each other. </s>
<s>[INST] 23. What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization? What is their significance? [/INST] L1 regularization (Lasso regularization)adds the sum of the absolute values of the model's weights to the loss function. This penalty encourages sparsity in the model by pushing the weights of less important features to exactly zero. As a result, L1 regularization automatically performs feature selection, removing irrelevant or redundant features from the model, which can improve interpretability and reduce overfitting. </s>
<s>[INST] 24. What is a radial basis function? [/INST] RBF (radial basis function) is a real-valued function used in machine learning whose value only depends upon the input and fixed point called the center. </s>
<s>[INST] 26. Does the accuracy score always a good metric to measure the performance of a classification model? [/INST] No, there are times when we train our model on an imbalanced dataset the accuracy score is not a good metric to measure the performance of the model. In such cases, we use precision and recall to measure the performance of a classification model. </s>
<s>[INST] 27. What is KNN Imputer and how does it work? [/INST] KNN Imputer imputes missing values in a dataset compared to traditional methods like using mean, median, or mode. It is based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which fills missing values by referencing the values of the nearest neighbors. </s>
<s>[INST] 29. What is the purpose of splitting a given dataset into training and validation data? [/INST] The main purpose is to keep some data left over on which the model has not been trained so, that we can evaluate the performance of our machine learning model after training. Also, sometimes we use the validation dataset to choose among the multiple state-of-the-art machine learning models. Like we first train some models let’s say LogisticRegression, XGBoost, or any other than test their performance using validation data and choose the model which has less difference between the validation and the training accuracy. </s>
<s>[INST] 31. What is the difference between k-means and the KNN algorithm? [/INST] K-means algorithm is one of the popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms which is used for clustering purposes. But, KNN is a model which is generally used for the classification task and is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The k-means algorithm helps us to label the data by forming clusters within the dataset. </s>
<s>[INST] 32. What is Linear Discriminant Analysis? [/INST] Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised machine learning dimensionality reduction technique because it uses target variables also for dimensionality reduction. It is commonly used for classification problems. The LDA mainly works on two objectives: </s>
<s>[INST] 33. How can we visualize high-dimensional data in 2-d? [/INST] One of the most common and effective methods is by using the t-SNE algorithm which is a short form for t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. This algorithm uses some non-linear complex methods to reduce the dimensionality of the given data. We can also use PCA or LDA to convert n-dimensional data to 2 - dimensional so, that we can plot it to get visuals for better analysis. But the difference between the PCA and t-SNE is that the former tries to preserve the variance of the dataset but the t-SNE tries to preserve the local similarities in the dataset. </s>
<s>[INST] 34. What is the reason behind the curse of dimensionality? [/INST] As the dimensionality of the input data increases the amount of data required to generalize or learn the patterns present in the data increases. For the model, it becomes difficult to identify the pattern for every feature from the limited number of datasets or we can say that the weights are not optimized properly due to the high dimensionality of the data and the limited number of examples used to train the model. Due to this after a certain threshold for the dimensionality of the input data, we have to face the curse of dimensionality. </s>
<s>[INST] 35. Which metric is more robust to outliers: MAE, MSE, or RMSE? [/INST] Out of the three metrics—Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)—MAE is more robust to outliers. </s>
<s>[INST] 36. Why removing highly correlated features are considered a good practice? [/INST] When two features are highly correlated, they may provide similar information to the model, which may cause overfitting. If there are highly correlated features in the dataset then they unnecessarily increase the dimensionality of the feature space and sometimes create the problem of the curse of dimensionality. If the dimensionality of the feature space is high then the model training may take more time than expected, it will increase the complexity of the model and chances of error. This somehow also helps us to achieve data compression as the features have been removed without much loss of data. </s>
<s>[INST] 37. What is the difference between the content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms of recommendation systems? [/INST] In a content-based recommendation system, similarities in the content and services are evaluated, and then by using these similarity measures from past data we recommend products to the user. But on the other hand in collaborative filtering, we recommend content and services based on the preferences of similar users. </s>
<s>[INST] 38. How you would assess the goodness-of-fit for a linear regression model? Which metrics would you consider most important and why? [/INST] To evaluate the performance of a linear regression model, important key metrics are: R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, RMSE, and F-Statistics. R-squared is particularly important as it reflects the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables, providing a measure of how well our model fits the data. However, Adjusted R-squared also plays a crucial role, especially when comparing models with different numbers of predictors. It adjusts for the complexity of the model, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring the robustness of our findings. </s>
<s>[INST] 39. What is the null hypothesis in linear regression problem? [/INST] In linear regression, the null hypothesis id that there is no relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. This is formally represented as H_0: \beta_1 = 0, where \beta_1​ is the coefficient of the independent variable. </s>
<s>[INST] 40. Can SVMs be used for both classification and regression tasks? [/INST] Yes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be used for both classification and regression. For classification, SVMs work by finding a hyperplane that separates different classes in the data with the largest gap possible. </s>
<s>[INST] 41. Explain the concept of weighting in KNN? What are the different ways to assign weights, and how do they affect the model's predictions? [/INST] Weighting in KNN assigns different levels of importance to the neighbors based on their distance from the query point, influencing how each neighbor affects the model's predictions. </s>
<s>[INST] 42. What are the assumptions behind the K-means algorithm? How do these assumptions affect the results? [/INST] The assumptions of K-Means algorithm include: </s>
<s>[INST] 43. Can you explain the concept of convergence in K-means? What conditions must be met for K-means to converge? [/INST] Convergence in K-means occurs when the cluster centroids stabilize, and the assignment of data points to clusters no longer changes. This happens when the algorithm has minimized the sum of squared distances between points and their corresponding centroids. </s>
<s>[INST] 44. What is the significance of tree pruning in XGBoost? How does it affect the model? [/INST] Tree pruning in XGBoost is used to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting. XGBoost implements a "pruning-as-you-grow" strategy where it starts by growing a full tree up to a maximum depth, then prunes back the branches that contribute minimal gains in terms of loss reduction. This is guided by the gamma parameter, which sets a minimum loss reduction required to make further partitions on a leaf node. </s>
<s>[INST] 45. How does Random Forest ensure diversity among the trees in the model? [/INST] Random Forest ensures diversity among the trees in its ensemble through two main mechanisms: </s>
<s>[INST] 46. What is the concept of information gain in decision trees? How does it guide the creation of the tree structure? [/INST] Information gain is a measure used in decision trees to select the best feature that splits the data into the most informative subsets. It is calculated based on the reduction in entropy or impurity after a dataset is split on an attribute. Entropy is a measure of the randomness or uncertainty in the data set, and information gain quantifies how much splitting on a particular attribute reduces that randomness. </s>
<s>[INST] 47. How does the independence assumption affect the accuracy of a Naive Bayes classifier? [/INST] Naive Bayes classifier operates under the assumption that all features in the dataset are independent of each other given the class label. This assumption simplifies the computation of the classifier's probability model, as it allows the conditional probability of the class given multiple features to be calculated as the product of the individual probabilities for each feature. </s>
<s>[INST] 48. Why does PCA maximize the variance in the data? [/INST] PCA aims to maximize the variance because variance represents how much information is spread out in a given direction. The higher the variance along a direction, the more information that direction holds about the data. By focusing on the directions of highest variance, PCA helps us: </s>
<s>[INST] 49. How do you evaluate the effectiveness of a machine learning model in an imbalanced dataset scenario? What metrics would you use instead of accuracy? [/INST] We can use Precision, Recall, F1 score and ROC-AUC to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning model in imbalanced dataset scenario. The best metric is F1 score as it combines both precision and recall into single metric that is important in imbalanced datasets where a high number of true negatives can skew accuracy. By focusing on both false positives and false negatives, the F1-score ensures that both the positive class detection and false positives are accounted for. </s>
<s>[INST] 50. How the One-Class SVM algorithm works for anomaly detection? [/INST] One-Class SVM is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm. It is often used when only normal data is available. The model learns a decision boundary around normal data points using a kernel, typically an RBF, to map the data into a higher-dimensional space. The algorithm identifies support vectors—data points closest to the boundary—and any new data point outside this boundary is flagged as an anomaly. Key parameters like 'nu' control the fraction of outliers allowed, while the kernel defines the boundary shape. </s>
